Goal: Time Travel. 
==================

Status: 
--------
- [x] Parsing .txt from gowalla data into usable .csv ugh so easy yet so tedious
- [ ] Writing first round of queries
- [ ] Fleshing out the plot
- [ ] Thinking of more steps

Main Character: 
----------------
Our Hero/Everyman AKA Watson AKA Arthur Dent AKA Bilbo Baggins AKA A. Square 

Goal: 
-------------------------------
Find and Deliver the package to Molly Millons AKA Get the Ring to Mt. Doom

The Problem:
-------------------------------
Molly Millons/Mt. Doom is hopping, slowly, through time

But Wait:
-------------------------------
Watson has a time machine, and knows where to find the package

The Twist: 
-------------------------------
Time is rebuilt after every time hop - if a hop results in the package never being picked up by Watson:
* obvioulsy Watson has to go pick it up (again? or for the first time?)
* someone else might pick it up and move it
* the package is travelling forward in time at a normal speed
